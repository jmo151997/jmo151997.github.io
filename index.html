	<h3> Duck Hunting Guides: John Micheal O'Quinn and Jack Evans </h3>

	<h2> About Our Guides </h2>
	<p> John Michael graduated from the University of Georgia and Jack graduated from the University of Georgia Southern. Both of our guides are avid duck hunters and love the outdoors. They both started hunting at a very young age. With both having over 20 years of experience, they know how to find the ducks and make sure you aren't disappointed!
	</p>

	<h2> Hunting </h2>
	<p>
	We have just over 1500 acres of wetlands with over 100 different blinds that are all great spots to hunt. We try to keep our hunts at a maximum of 5 hunters per guide. We kill a variety of different birds like: Mallards, Pintails, Wood ducks, Ring necks, Redheads, Teal, Widgeons, Snow Geese, Canadian Geese, Specs and many more! Although we hunt primarily flooded corn fields, you also have a choice of hunting flooded timbers, and open wetlands as well.
	</p>

	<h2> Lodging </h2>
	<p>
	We also offer lodging for $30/person each night. They are filled with nice furniture and have many cabin like features to make you feel right at home. A great place to stay after a long day of hunting!
